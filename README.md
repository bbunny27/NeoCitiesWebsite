<h2> Creating a new neocities website (for fun)</h2>
<p> I was recently inttroduced to a website (social network?) called neocities! It's mission is to attempt to reclaim the web from corporate entities by promoting and supporting indivudals to create their own websites. It's relatively popular and has an incredibly large community of talented creators that interact with each other's websites, and promote indivudality in an internet that is dominated by corporate interests. It also feels like a bastion of the old internet.</p>
<h3> Why is this a repository?</h3>
<p>  This is a repository because I wanted to upload my code, and I think having my old code to look back to will be interesting as my website building skills continually improve. </p>
